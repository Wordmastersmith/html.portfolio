<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>A martial artist at heart and office worker because of bills, I am now on my new journey of self-discovery. I am currently working 
to improve and upscale my tech skills by learning through various bootcamps and online resources.  Having worked for 10 years 
in the healthcare/heathinsurace field I am now ready to set my sights on something I've wanted to try for awhile now, web development.</p>

<p>I have always prided myself on my creativity, always having fun just brainstorming ideas, and not for just any one area of focus.  I can come up 
with a movie idea one minute, then an app the next, or even a piece of legislation that could have a postive impact on society at large. Then it hit me, I needed 
something new to help my creativity flourish. I needed to create, but not just pen to paper, but to create with different tools and structures from what I've grown accostomed.
</p>

<p>By fanning the flames of my insatiable learning passions, I see how daunting the world of programming and web development can be, but I also
see an invigorated me, reenergized, but with the same martial arts heart who knows that as long as you put in the work, improvment, achievment, but most 
importantly, the feeling of accomplishment.
